original PKIS1 dataset, downloaded from link in manuscript

PKIS_screening_data.csv


use the prep scripts to transpose data into 366 cpds * 224 targets

in the original 369 cpds were 3 duplicate mols in the list (duplicate SMILES and CHEMBL_ID)

the prep script uses the average activity value for the duplicates



for the 1 uM data, there were repeat assays by Frye lab. I only kept the Nanosyn assay results to keep data consistent
