Prepare histograms showing distribution of active compound fractions for PKIS1 and PKIS2 targets. Show where the new targets sit within this distribution.

The active label is assigned to any compound passing mu+2sigma threshold for percent inhibition for a given compound set (PKIS1 or PKIS2) on the target of interest.

The threshold is thus target dependent.
